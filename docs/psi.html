Panther's Slick Interface Library (PSILib)

<p>This library is a display layer which handles window frames, and has many 
classes of controls ready.  There are some caveats to using this library,
and I will try my best to cover them all.  

<p>Some terminology/philosophy...
<p>FRAME - this is a window frame control.  It contains controls and perhaps
other frames.  This is the backdrop on which other objects are hung.  A frame
has a caption, perhaps some control icons like Close, Max, Min, Resize.  It
handles shadow and highlight attributes, may be aligned to match the color
mapping on a Windows system.  Otherwise, There are standard colors which all
controls reference in order to draw shadow, highlight, shade, normal, text,
titlebars active and inactive, etc.

<p>CONTROL - This is a generic control class.  It has the ability to display a
border without caption.  All content of a specific type of control must be
constructed by the control itself.  Controls have a couple callbacks to handle
mouse and keyboard inputs, and to draw their content.  

<p>Some Liscensing issues have been mentioned.  Ownership of code, perhaps, some
ego that there is monitary value in the code itself and not the service it
provides.  That is, in this library, a control, provides an interface between
the.... Lisenscing on this library, the core (all of PSILib) is LGPL, as
expressed near the root on this collection.  The following exception applies:

<p>If you make modifications, and do not remit to the core library for inclusion
within the LGPL distribution of this library, then you may not share the
source of this library either.  Updates to the core from the common LGPL
sources are permitted, but if additions to this library, control extensions 
for example, are not released in source for public use, then no other part
of this library may be shared.

<p>A Divergant thread<br>
-----------------------
<p>Windows systems use a WindowProc( WINDOW HANDLE, MESSAGE, PARAMS )... some
other systems like SDL provide these as an EVENT structure with message ID
content, and perhaps a union of structures based on the message type, this 
is similar to the method used by X to get events.  QNX Photon uses a callback
system, where if you want a specific type of message, you register a specific
routine to handle the message.  The difference between the two methods - the 
first has a dispatch like this...

<p>The first two (Windows, SDL/X )<br>
------------------
<pre>
switch(message id) { 
	case DRAW: 
		DrawProc(); break;
	case MOUSE: 
		MouseProc(); break;
	case KEYBOARD: 
		KeyboardProc(); break;
}
</pre>

<p>The other<br>
-----------------
<pre>
RegisterDraw( DrawProc );
RegisterMouse( MouseProc );
RegisterKeyboard( KeyboardProc):
</pre>
<p>In the first case, everything is jammed together into a single message
and the application must dispatch to the appropriate method, in the latter
when that event happens it goes directly to the appropriate method handler.
If the event goes directly to the handler, there is no code to format a message
in a general format, to queue that message, and to then disect the message.

<hr>
So what do I do with this thing?<br>
-----------------------------------------

<p>Well to use these methods you need to....<br>
#include <controls.h>

<p>And of course once you've compiled you'll want to link the code in....
Link with psi (psis.lib, psi.lib, libpsis.a, libpsi.so)

<p>This library may require other libraries if linked statically. 
Required Libraries: procreg, or video/display

<p>This library is actually able to utilize multiple interfaces dynamically.
It uses the image interface described in <imginterface.h>, and also the 
active image interface in <actimg.h>.

<p>Well - you've included the header? Ready to code a dialog?<br>
------------------------------------------

<!--
<p>Let's init the library....
<pre>
	SetControlImageInterface( GetImageInterface() );
	SetControlInterface( GetDisplayInterface() );
</pre>

<p>The image interface and the display interface NEED to be set before the 
library is loaded.  Soon this can/will default to the appropriate library, 
however for certain complications, the method is now to link statically.

-->
<p>Let's declare a frame...
<pre>
	PCOMMON pFrame;  
</pre>
<p>Well okay we NEVER declare a FRAME type.  It's always a 
pointer(handle/reference) to the FRAME object we create.
<pre>
	pFrame = CreateFrame( "My First Frame", 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, NULL );
        CreateFrame( caption, x, y, w, h, Border Flags, Frame which this is over );
</pre>
<p>Okay so we get a frame, but didn't specify any special position or size, or
  
relation to any other frame.  That's okay - it'll work.  What you'll get is
a frame (somewhere, maybe where your mouse is) and it will be 256 by 256 
containable space.  The boarder and caption on this (by the way, the caption
will of course read "My First Frame" ) will make the actual area larger than 
this.
<pre>
	AddCommonButtons( pFrame, NULL, NULL );
</pre>
<p>And we add an okay and a cancel button to the dialog.  These are biased from
the lower right hand corner, and are a fixed size.  There is an extended version
of this function which allows you to specify more detail.  Either NULL may
be replace by the address of an integer.  The first pointer will be non-zero
if the Okay button was pressed.  The second pointer will be non-zero if the 
Cancel button was pressed.  Otherwise, they will be 0.  (Perhaps if the close
icon is pressed, the result will be neither true).  
<pre>
   DisplayFrame( pFrame );
</pre>

<p>And - until JUST now, the frame we made was invisible.  This finally shows
the frame.  It's kinda a good idea to create all your controls on the frame and
THEN display it.  Otherwise, ya know you get to see each control drawn.  
<pre>
   CommonWait( pFrame );
</pre>
<!--
<p>It is legal/valid, to pass NULL and NULL to this routine, however, these should
be the addresses of the integer variables passed to AddCommonButtons().  If any
There are other ways to get the result of a frame, to be discussed later.
Okay - now we wait.  This routine will return if a> the okay button is pressed,
b> if the cancel button is pressed, or c> if the dialog were closed otherwise.
You may not want to wait, and there is provision for that also, but I'll not 
get into that.  
-->
<p>CommonWait will wait for the buttons okay/cancel to be invoked.
<pre>
   DestroyFrame( pFrame );
</pre>
<p>And now we're done with that frame, destroy it.  It will also destroy any
of the controls and other frames it contains.  If you have a pointer to a 
control, it is NOT valid after a destroy frame.

<p>And that's the code of void main(void) - for a hello world program PSI style.

<p>well now, that was fun, but I want ...<br>
---------------------------------------------

<p>Oh? You think you'd maybe like to have some other controls?  Well, I might
suggest that you skip down a bit, and browse through the library docs.

<p>Oh my - where to start?  This could easily EASY have a C++ wrapper.  If
it ain't object oriented it ain't worth keeping.

Quick coverage of basic functions.

Libray Setup/Configuration
----------
void SetControlInterface( PACTIMGINTERFACE DisplayInterface )
	This sets the active image interface which the library will use.  If there
is no interface described, the library may, and probably will, attempt to load
a dynamic library for this function.  There are multiple libraries on some
platforms which will work, and this should not be left for the library to 
decide.

void SetControlImageInterface ( PIMAGEINTERFACE DisplayInterface );
   Sets the image interface which the library will use.  As with 
SetControlInterface, if not set, the library will try to load a library
to attempt to use.  
    

void AlignBaseToWindows( void );
	In a windows system, this aligns the standard colors used for the frames
and controls.  Other systems may not have the ability to share that information.

void SetBaseColor( INDEX idx, CDATA c );
	From an external source, one may define the colors to be used for 
Standard controls.  See the color indexes defined above for valid identifiers
to use for 'idx', the use/meaning of the color is also described above.  
Also, See colordef.(h/doc).

//-------- Frame and generic control functions --------------

PSI_PROC( PFRAME, CreateFrame)( char *caption, int x, int y
   						, int w, int h
     						, uint32_t BorderFlags
    						, PFRAME hAbove );

Creates a frame, a window if you will, it has a title bar, and someday icons to 
close, iconize, maximize.  The (w)idth and (h)eight paremaeters define the
drawable surface of the frame, and do not include the border or caption which will
be extended beyond this.

Frames may be optioned with BORDER_RESIZABLE to make
the border stretchable.  BORDER_WANTMOUSE will give the frame itself all mouse
events, otherwise the events are very reducded. 

A sub-frame may be created by specifying BORDER_WITHIN, and hAbove as the parent
frame.  This will provide a titleless, (borderless? border invert, thinner, etc should
apply to these boxes, but then do be aware that the width and height define the 
usable surface and any border extends beyond that.



PSI_PROC( void, DestroyFrame)( PFRAME pf );

Destroys a created frame.  All controls which exist within the frame are also
destroyed.  Some controls may have an event callback so that they may do custom
destruction code.

PSI_PROC( void, DisplayFrame)( PFRAME pf );

Enable a frame on the display.  When a frame is first created it is in a non-display
mode.  This allows one to create controls on its surface without cascading updates.
After DisplayFrame is called, the window is enabled and visible.  There is no way
to undo this.

PSI_PROC( void, SizeFrame)( PFRAME pf, int w, int h );

A frame might be resized using this routine.  All controls are instructed to redraw
after the sizing is done.

PSI_PROC( void, MoveFrame)( PFRAME pf, int x, int y );

This moves a frame on the presumed larger display.  A window may be moved with this
even if BORDER_NOMOVE is optioned when the frame is created.

PSI_PROC( PCONTROL, GetControl)( PFRAME pf, int ID );

Get a control handle by searching for and ID within a frame.

//PSI_PROC void SetDefaultOkayID( PFRAME pFrame, int nID );
//PSI_PROC void SetDefaultCancelID( PFRAME pFrame, int nID );

//-------- Generic control functions --------------
PSI_PROC( PFRAME, GetFrame)( PCONTROL pc );

Gets top level parent of a control.  (This may return the first parent frame?)

PSI_PROC( PCONTROL, GetNearControl)( PCONTROL pc, int ID );

Gets a control handle from a frame which has the unique control identifier ID.  (See CreateControl)
This however searches near another control, and only within the frame immediatly containing
the control specified.

PSI_PROC( void, GetControlTextEx)( PCONTROL pc, char *buffer, int buflen, int bCString );

Gets text from a control.  The extended option bCString will process \n within 
the buffer and replace with the binary newline character.  \r, and some others 
may also be interpreted.

#define GetControlText( pc, buffer, buflen ) GetControlTextEx( pc, buffer, buflen, FALSE )

By default text retrieved from a control is literal and does not perform any interpretations.

PSI_PROC( void, SetControlText)( PCONTROL pc, char *text );

Set the text of a control.  The usage of this field is control specific.  For a frame,
this will modify the caption bar if present.  For text fields, the text shown is modified,
buttons, changes the text on the button, Edit fields will set the text which is in the 
box.  Probably some other options such as combo boxes may also make use of this.  All
controls have a text field.  It is a duplicate of the text passed in, and the pointer
is not retained.

PSI_PROC( void, SetControlFocus)( PCONTROL pc );

Sets the active focus to a control.  The keyboard input when the frame is focused on the
display goes to this control.

PSI_PROC( void, EnableControl)( PCONTROL pc, int bEnable );

This serves as a disable control also.  !bEnable = disable.  (enable FALSE is disable, 
enable TRUE is enable ).  A disabled control has a status flag changed in its control 
structure, and its draw method is invoked.

PSI_PROC( int, IsControlEnabled)( PCONTROL pc );

Query a control for its current enabled status.

PSI_PROC( PCONTROL, CreateControl)( PFRAME pFrame
                      , int nID
                      , int x, int y
                      , int w, int h
                      , int BorderType
                      , int extra );
                      
Creates a control within the frame specified.
nID is a unique control ID for searching using GetControl.
x, y, w, h are positional and size coordinates.
BorderType uses the same options as frames.
extra is the amount of extra space to allocate at the end of 
the control... Why?  Well it's kinda crazy really....
----------------------------------
Controls really require intimite knowledge of the library.  This 
is acheived by including <controlstruc.h> from the psilib directory
itself.  It is not a publicly shared interface.  As provided by 
licensing controls may be added directly to this project.  Since
linking within the library is required on some platforms, this has
been allowed.... hwoever...

#include <../src/psilib/controlstruc.h>

typedef struct mycontrol_tag { 
   // depending on the compiler, one may include as an anonymous 
   // structure the control structure. 
   CONTROL;
   // but since there are some compilers which object to this
   // the controls within this library are declared with
   // CONTROL common;
   
   /* Add your own needed structures/members here */
   
} MYCONTROL, *PMYCONTROL;

Then to create one of these controls the size of extra would be

sizeof( MYCONTROL ) - sizeof( CONTROL )
---------------------------------------


PSI_PROC( ImageFile *,GetControlSurface)( PCONTROL pc );

This works to get the frame surface also, actually I think this 
is obslete and there is now a more general GetCommonSurface(PCOMMON) which
has alias macros GetFrameSurface and GetControlSurface which cast their
members to a PCOMMON.  

PSI_PROC( void, SetControlDraw)( PCONTROL pc, void (*Draw)(PTRSZVAL pc ) );

Set the routine to be called when the control needs to be updated.  There are 
few events which cause a control to update.

PSI_PROC( void, SetControlMouse)( PCONTROL pc, void (*MouseMethod)(PTRSZVAL pc, int x, int y, int b ) );

Set the mouse handling method for the control.  See /* insert link here */ Render/Display libraries about mouse
method callbacks for more information. 

//PSI_PROC void SetControlKey( PCONTROL pc, void (*KeyMethod)( PCONTROL pc, int key ) );



PSI_PROC( void, UpdateControl)( PCONTROL pc );

Cause a control to update. 

PSI_PROC( int, GetControlID)( PCONTROL pc );

Returns the unique ID which the control was created with or that it
was assigned.
              
PSI_PROC( void, DestroyControl)( PCONTROL pc );

Destroys a control.

PSI_PROC( void, SetNoFocus)( PCONTROL pc );

Disallow a control from getting focus either by clicking on it, or by tabbing to it.

PSI_PROC( void, *ControlExtraData)( PCONTROL pc );

Returns the base pointer of the additional data of a control.
Perhaps a better design of controls would be to define a structure
which contains everything unique to a new control, however, it 
has been often the case that both elements in the base common control
structure as well as private members are updated at the same time...
that it it would often be difficult to write routines which worked purely
on a control's private members.

//------ General Utilities ------------
// adds OK and Cancel buttons based off the 
// bottom right of the frame, and when pressed set
// either done (cancel) or okay(OK) ...

Add a done and and done with success button to a frame.  These buttons
are located in the lower right hand corner, offset approcimately 5 units
from the frame's edge, and are approcimately 18 x 55.  The text passed will 
be shown on the buttons, and the integer pointers are to reference integer values
which are initially 0, and will be set with status of the button pressed.

Simple AddCommonButtons( pf, done, "Cancel", okay "Okay" );

PSI_PROC( void, CommonLoop)( int *done, int *okay ); // perhaps give a callback for within the loop?

A wait for positive status return based on the two pointers passed to 
add common buttons.  One may use this loop with other method, but it 
works best with the common buttons.

PSI_PROC( void, ProcessControlMessages)(void);

When idling, within a callback invoked from the PSI library, this needs to be called.
The preferred method is actually to use idle(); from the idle library, within
which PSI sets this routine to be called as a set of idle calls.  This allows the
thread which may be needed for serviceing events to service its events.  This
can also cause recursion...  In general it is best to not wait within a draw callback,
mouse update, or any other callback which has been set.  They are meant to be short,
and to always return before any further event is processed.

Controls</h3></center>
<hr>
<p>All controls have the following arguments
<menu>
<br>PFRAME pContainer - the container to put the control into.
<br>, uint32_t attr - attributes - custom per control. see LIST_OPT for instance.
<br>, int32_t x, y - the x,y position within the frame to create the control at.
<br>, uint32_t width, height - the size of the control surface, including the border.
<br>, uint32_t ID - the ID of the control, for reference by GetControl() for instance.

                  This makes a normal, default, button.  Text on the button is the caption.  The PushMethod callback
                  is invoked when the button is fully pressed and then released, a false press (click on button, 
                  move off button, release is NOT a press).
