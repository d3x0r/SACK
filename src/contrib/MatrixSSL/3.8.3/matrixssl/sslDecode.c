	Parse incoming data per http://wp.netscape.com/eng/ssl3

	Input parameters to decode:
	.	buf points to the start of data to decode
	.	len points to the length in bytes of data to decode
	.	size is the number of allocated bytes that follow buf



	Meaningful parameters after the call to decode:
	MATRIXSSL_SUCCESS
	.	buf will point to the first undecoded byte (could==inbuf or inbuf+inlen)
	.	remaining will indicate how many more bytes of undecoded data remain
	*	call again if more to decode or return if handshake is complete

	SSL_PARTIAL
	.	buf will not have moved (because partials start parse over)
	.	reqLen will indicate how many bytes the entire full record is
	*	get more data from peer and call again

	SSL_FULL (implies decode completed fully but couldn't fit response)
	.	buf will not have moved (it is reset to the front of final record)
	.	len will be 0 to indicate no remaining unprocessed data
	.	reqLen will inform how large buf should be grown before re-invoking
	*	realloc the buf to the reqLen size and call again

	SSL_SEND_RESPONSE
	.	buf will point to the encoded handshake data to send
	.	len will be length of data to send (from start offset)
	*	pass the buf to the transport layer for sending to peer

	SSL_ALERT
	.	buf will point to start of received alert (2 bytes alert level and desc)
	.	len will be length of alert data (should be 2)
	.	alertLevel will be 1 (warning) or 2 (fatal)
	.	alertDesc will be SSL specified alert code

	MATRIXSSL_ERROR (unrecoverable failure)
	.	decodeErr is internal parse err code

	SSL_PROCESS_DATA (ONLY CASE WITH DECRYPTED DATA AND POSSIBLE UNENCRYPTED)
	.	unencrypted user data ready for processing is at prevBuf
	.	buf points to start of any remaining unencrypted data
	.	remaining is length of remaining encrypted data yet to decode
	.	len is length of unencrypted data ready for user processing
	*	pass unencypted data to application level
	*	call decode again if more encrypted data remaining
