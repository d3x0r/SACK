<p>This map demonstrates at least one of every relationship an object might
have to other objects.&nbsp; The Void contains Room and Some Thing.&nbsp;
Room is attached to Another Room. (Note: Another Room might not be considered
present within The Void, since it is held by Room)&nbsp; Within Room, A Comfy Chair 
and MOOSE are present.&nbsp; MOOSE is holding (attached to) Held Object.&nbsp;
MOOSE contains (possesses) one and two.
<p>From MOOSE's perspective, one, two, Held Object, Comfy Chair, Another Room, and
Room are all visible.&nbsp; MOOSE could /ENTER Another Room and Comfy Chair.&nbsp;
MOOSE could /LEAVE and be in The Void.&nbsp; If MOOSE were given a command, 
which was a macro name, it would check first its own macros, then the macros
of Room.&nbsp; Regardless of where the macro is found, the variables used
are ALWAYS contained within the active object.
<p>There will come a time when more than one object of the same name
will be visible.&nbsp; When there are more than one objects of the same name
1.object, 2.object, n.object, can be used to select objects other than the
first.&nbsp; Objects are checked for presence first in the contents of self,
then held objects, and finally then objects in the same room.&nbsp;
Many commands check
only these, the set of 'grabbable' objects.&nbsp; Some commands will additionally
check objects attached to the current room, and then the room the object is
in.&nbsp;
A DESTROY command will then check macros on the current object for a match.
<p>When a macro is defined it is stored in the current object.&nbsp; When 
a command is entered to invoke a macro, the current object is checked first,
if the macro is not found, the object containing the current is checked.&nbsp;
This allows macros for 'rooms' to be defined, so any object within it may use
the macro.&nbsp; Only these two levels are checked.&nbsp; An object does not
have to be aware to have a macro defined for it; /macro [IN [object]] [name]
[parameters...] will define a macro in the specified object, if the object is
visible.
<p>When a variable is declared, the variable is stored in the object.&nbsp; If
the variable is declared within a macro, the variable is stored in the current
macro state.&nbsp; A variable can be defined in any visible object using
'/declare in [object] [varname] [value...]'.&nbsp; If the object specified is
visible, this command will succeed.&nbsp; When a macro references a variable,
first the parameters to the macro are checked, then the macros defined in the
current macro state, and finally the variables defined for the object.&nbsp;
If the variable is found in the object's variable space, subsequent declares
will modify that value, not create a new one in the macro state.
