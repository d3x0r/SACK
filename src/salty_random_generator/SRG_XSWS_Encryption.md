# XSWS

This was Xor, Sub, Wipe(LR,sub,RL), Sub.  While this had slightly higher performance, it produced
encrypted data with an obvious period.  This algorithm can be applied to buffer in-place.

# X(WS)*(WS)*

Revision 2
  - Moves byte map swap into wipe stage.

This is an encryption algorithm called Xor-Sub-Wipe-Sub (XSWS). 
 - Xor - the initial masking of data with a 256 bit mask
 - Wipe-subByte ( xor each byte with the previous byte L->R ). (use 0x55 as first prvious byte)
 - Wipe-subByte ( xor each byte with the previous byte R->L ). (use 0xAA as the first previous byte)

 
It is built on Salty Random Generator(SRG).  SRG uses various hash
algorithms to generate streams of random bits.  It then consumes bits
generated from the hashing function.  This specifically uses K12.
There really isn't any specific function SRG does that can't just
be done directly against the hash digests.

Byte 0 is least significant byte, and is consumed from hashes first.
bit 0 is the least value (1) of byte 0 is the very first bit consumed.
Otherwise all other operations are on parallel bytes, and endian-ness
should not matter; all final entropy reads are done in byte sized units.

## Overview

Take an input if less than 4096 bytes, add one byte to the length, and pad
to 8 byte boundary (int64); the length of the pad is stored in the last
byte; unused padding bytes will be set to 0.  (Block Padding...)[#Block_padding]

### Summary

   - Simple xor of a 256 bit mask computed from the key using KangarooTwelve(K12) over the key data.
   - Setup 256 byte swap map. (M)
   - xor 0x55 into first byte, swap byte for some other byte, store that result, use that result to xor on the next byte, repeatedly.
       1. T(0) = B(0) ^ 0x55
       2. R(0) = map T(0) byte to another byte using M
       3. T(N) = B(N) ^ R(N-1)
       4. R(N) = map T(N) byte to another byte using M
       5. repeat  3-4 until no byte bytes
   - xor 0xAA into last byte, swap byte for some other byte, store that result, use that result to xor on the previous byte, repeatedly.
       1. T(N) = B(N) ^ 0xAA
       2. R(N) = map T(N) byte to naother byte using M
       3. T(N-1) = B(N-1) ^ R(N)
       4. R(N-1) = map T(N-1) byte to naother byte using M
       5. repeat  3-4 until first byte
 
   - T is a temporary value
   - B is input Byte 
   - R is Result byte
   - N represents position in a string of bytes
   - M is the xbox map built below
 
Data is processed in blocks of 4096 bytes.  XOR pass uses wide integers to reduce time.  Blocks
MUST be padded to a multiple of 8 bytes.  Blocks that ARE a multiple of 8 bytes may or may not have
padding.  This allows multiple sections of large data to be processed in parallel.
A 1 bit change in the plain text will only affect the 4096 byte block it is in; but will on average
cause 16384 (of 32768) bits to change in the output.


## xbox generation

The XBox is a unique 2way exchange mapping of input A to output B, and B to A.  
This is done with 1 512 byte array.  This is the mapping used for 'swap byte with
another random byte'.  The first 256 bytes map A->B, and the second 256 bytes map B->A.
The second 256 bytes are derrived from the first 256 bytes.

This uses 256*8 bits of entropy and does a quick in-place swapping algorithm
to shuffle the bytes.  The first 256 bits of entropy are used for masking the
blocks initially, followed by these.

This is done with the same random_context as the source hash.


```
struct byte_shuffle_key {
    uint8_t map[256], dmap[256];
};

struct byte_shuffle_key *BlockShuffle_ByteShuffler( struct random_context *ctx ) {
	struct byte_shuffle_key *key = New( struct byte_shuffle_key );
	int n;
	int srcMap;

	// initialize map with default 1:1 map
	for( n = 0; n < 256; n++ )
		key->map[n] = n;

	// simple-in-place shuffler.
	for( n = 0; n < 256; n++ ) {
		int m; // the position to move
		int t; // temp
		SRG_GetByte_( m, ctx ); // m = next random 8 bits
		t = key->map[m];
		key->map[m] = key->map[n];
		key->map[n] = t;
	}

	/* generate reverse map */
	for( n = 0; n < 256; n++ )
		key->dmap[key->map[n]] = n;

	return key;
}
```

## Block padding...

Encryption is done in up to 4096 byte blocks.  

One(1) byte is added to the length, and then padded up to the next 8 byte boundary.

If the total block of data is larger than 4096 bytes; then each 4096 byte block is processed
separately.

The last byte of the last block is the number of bytes to remove from the end.  Other bytes 
added to pad to 8 byte boundary (will be 0 in this implementation, though there is no specific
requirement to be 0).


```
// 
encrypt( data, datalen ) { 
	int outlen = datalen + 1;
	
	if( outlen & 7 )
		outlen += ( 8 - (outlen&7) );
	
	char *output = malloc( outlen );
	((uin64_t*)( output + outlen-8 ))[0] = 0; // make sure all extra pad bytes are 0
	output[outlen-1] = outlen - datalen; // save pad to recover length.
	memcpy( output, data, datalen ); // encryption happens in-place.

	/* ... do real work ... */
}
```
 
## Algorithm Setup

The, current, strongest, fastest setup is done with K12.  Internally there is
support to change the CSPRNG; (SHA[1|2_256|2_512|3]|k12).

The algorithm performs quite a bit of setup before applying the transform
to data. There is a mask generated (basically) with 256 bits from K12(key data).

The same K12 hash generator is used from the initial seeding of the specified key information
is used for the mask and byte subtitution mapping creation.

```
	K12.Init()
	K12.Update( key );
	K12.Final();
	mask_entropy = K12.Squeeze( 256 );     // bits
	shuffle_entropy = K12.Squeeze( 256*8 );  // bits
```


__The other pre-generated data is the xbox, which uses 25+86 bits from the
same K12 bitstream to shuffle the substitution map (**)[xbox-generation]. __
 


## Detail of the algorithm

This is very old notes; the weakness with just a XOR operation swipe left-right.
With the sustitution done with each xor swap the following weakness disappears.



input keys of < hash size bits are the same as a buffer filled with 0's 
to pad to length of hash.  ( a 3-bit 0 is same as a 0-bit 0 ).

mask = 256 bit hash (K12) based on input key of 0-N bits.

Decode is the inverse of the ALL above steps, using BlockShuffle_BusBytes (Reverse of Sub)
for the swap instead. (xor-wipe is inversed too)

	uint8_t *curBuf = output;
	for( n = 0; n < (len - 1); n++, curBuf++ ) {

	}
	curBuf[0] = curBuf[0] ^ 0xAA;
	
	BlockShuffle_BusBytes_( bytKey, output, output, len );

	curBuf = output + len - 1;
	for( n = (len - 1); n > 0; n--, curBuf-- ) {
		curBuf[0] = curBuf[0] ^ curBuf[-1];
	}
	curBuf[0] = curBuf[0] ^ 0x55;

	BlockShuffle_BusBytes_( bytKey, output, output, len );

	for( n = 0; n < len; n += 8, output += 8 ) {
		((uint64_t*)output)[0] ^= ((uint64_t*)(bufKey + (n % (RNGHASH / 8))))[0];;
	}

For tiny blocks (44 bytes), AES is quite a bit faster (down to only like 7 times now)
For larger blocks, MyShuffle is faster.

1) the routine to remap the bytes is actually VERY slow. (it's not doing a lot of work, just... is slow)
2) I was shuffling the 256 card deck, assigning a random 8 bit number (0-255) and then sorting them based 
that number... that uses 2048 bits of randomness (calculates 4 K12 digests)... I pondered this for a while,
and reworked it so it uses only 148 bits to shuffle the cards.

2a ) split the 'deck' into left and right piles (top/bottom)

2b ) split each of those piles into 3 sections.  (each 1/3 of each half is mixed with a paired 1/3 of the other half)

2b1 ) on the left/top half, random order the piles so that 0 is not the first one (1,2,0)(1,0,2)(2,1,0)(2,0,1)  (keeps the top card from staying the top card)
2b2 ) on the right/bottom half, random order the piles so that 2 is not the last one (2,0,1)(2,1,0)(1,2,0)(0,2,1)  
2b3 ) choosing 1 of the 4 orders is only 2 bits (0,1,2,3); (twice, one order for left, one for right) 4 bits per round of shuffling.

2c ) flip a coin (8) times, if it's heads, use the left pile first, else use right pile first.

2d ) for each card in the 1/3 stack of left/right split... flip a coin.  Every time the coin is 'heads', switch which pile to pull cards from, saving the total cards pulled on the previous pile.
2c1 ) (label this countStack) (assume left is counted first)  
      T ( count:1 don't change  )
	  H ( count:2  store 2(from Left), reset count, change stacks : RIGHT )
	  H ( count:1  store 1(from Right), reset count, change stacks : LEFT )
      T ( count:1 don't change  )
      T ( count:2 don't change  )
	  H ( count:3  store 3(from Left), reset count, change stacks : RIGHT )
      T ( count:1 don't change  )
	  H ( count:2  store 2(from Right), reset count, change stacks : LEFT )
	  .... etc.
	  
3) for N rounds of shuffles.... for each card to shuffle

3a)   if( left ) use left stack, add one to count util the count in countStack is reached. switch to right.
3b)   if( right ) use right stack, add one to count util the count in countStack is reached.

3c)   if [left/right] 1/3 cut stack runs out of cards, then use the rest of the cards in the 1/3 cut stack, move to next third.

3d )  switch in-deck and out-deck, repeat round shuffle on this into next out-deck.


theoretial bit count : ( 8 * 4 ) + 8 + 86 + (86 * 0.001 /*add .1% */)  == (40 + 86.08) == [ 127 ]  

(using 127 bits is much better than 2048 :) )

And, man, does it take a lot of words to explain 'riffle shuffle' :)

## xbox generation (small-entropy)

This is a modified version of the above, it uses only approximately 112 bits of 
entropy to shuffle the deck.  This causes fewer hashes generated internally.

Pseudo-Random Bit (PRB) is a single bit from the entropy generating hash
function.  

The shuffle algorithm was implemented in such a way as to use only a few
bits from the entropy stream.  Other solutions used (8*256; 2K) bits, which
caused a heavier load on the hash generation.

The range of bytes is considered as a deck of cards.

In operation, the deck of cards is split into two equal stacks (128 each).
Each of these stack is then split into 3 ranges of 43 or 42 cards each.

The stacks are shuffled 5 times.
FOr each round, 2-PRB are used to determine the order of the left stacks,
another 2 PRB are used to determine the order of the right stacks. And 
1 PRB is picked to determine to start with left or right stack.

(25 bits)

1 PRB is picked to determine starting to... control a maximum card stack
length before forcing a swap.
(26 bits)

Then, ordering for as many as 86 cards is chosen.  Take one card from
one stack; get 1 PRB, if (1), take another card from the same stack; else
set the count of cards to take into the counter-list; and reset count to 1.
Repeat getting 1PRB, until enough cards are matched.  As many as 86 bits 
are used; THere is s small probability that enough cards have been counted
that the target stack is full, and just the remaining cards needs to be set 
on the other side. Additionally, if more than (4 or 5) cards in a row are 
picked, force saving that count, and 'switch stacks'.  The 1 PRB picked
earlier determines whether the limit is 4 or 5 cards, which is sort-of 
mapped to left/right stacks,  but depending on that bit, and the bit 
chosen for the shuffle round left/right swap.  

It's obvious, from counting the bits of entropy used, there is a maximum 
of 2^112 different outcomes.  Ideal permutations of 256 cards is factorial(256).
